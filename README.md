# CdCTask Project

# Introduction

  This project automates data processing tasks, a fictional food delivery service. It comprises various components such as DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) for scheduling tasks, data generation scripts, and documentation.

# Project Structure

  # The project directory structure is as follows:

    /dags: Contains DAGs for Apache Airflow scheduling.
    /data: Stores data-related files and scripts.
    /scripts: Houses custom scripts for data processing.
    /requirements.txt: File listing project dependencies.
    /task-documentation.pdf: Documentation providing details about the project tasks and processes.


# Components
  # DAGs (/dags)
    This directory contains DAGs used for scheduling tasks within Apache Airflow. These DAGs define the workflow and dependencies of various data processing tasks.

  # Data (/data)
    generate_fake_data.py: Python script to generate fake data for testing and development purposes.
    
  # Environment Configurations (/env)
    This directory is ignored by Git (specified in .gitignore) and should be created manually for environment setup.

# Installation:
    # Create the env folder and set up the virtual environment:
      Copy code
      virtualenv env
      
    # Activate the environment:
       Copy code
       source env/bin/activate
      
    # Install Python packages using requirements.txt:
       Copy code
       pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
  Refer to the task documentation (task-documentation.pdf) for detailed instructions on project usage, setup, and execution.
